after running code in interactive mode, you can optionally use following
commands for better visibility and understanding of detector geometry.

* /vis/viewer/set/style surface OR wireframe
* /vis/viewer/addCutawayPlane 0 1 0 
* /vis/viewer/set/background white


More commands to use in macros and interactive console can be found here:

# Instructions to run simulation
--------------------------------

* build code using cmake and make

    > mkdir build_sim
    > cd build_sim
    > cmake ../RPS2023
    > make
    
1) run code interative mode:

    > ./neutronBall
    > /control/execute file_name.mac

2) run code in batch mode

    > ./neutronBall file_name.mac

# commit notes (latest from bottom)
-----------------------------------

[1] upto this commit initial data analysis is performed on overall spherical
    soil horizon geometry to understand distributions of distance traveled by
    radon and other particles in various mediums.

[2] radon emanation study code is added with one soil grain with size 50um. 
    updated chemical composition for single soil grain from various sources 
    on web. primary partcle is radon with energy of 86 keV. simulation records 
    data of radon emanation and data analysis is performed to understand dependance 
    of radon emanation on moisture. emanation.mac file is used to run this commit code
    which assumes that radon atoms are uniformaly distributed in soil grain. 
    plotEmanationByH2O file should be used for getting plot. Before running this
    file you should combine all the data files using hadd mainfile.root file1 file2 ..

[3] this should be considered latest commit for radon emanation study. 
    plotEmanationByH2O.c macro is updated.

[4] steppingAction is updated with conditions of fStopAndKill track status conditions 
    to get count of particles which comes to rest after escaping soil grain.

[5] more percentage options are added from 0%, 75% with 5% increase.

[6] in case of uniform primary events with uniformEmanation.mac file, be careful because
    it can produce wierd plot of moisture level vs radon emanation. You have to shoot
    good amount of particles as comapared to particle size. For example, 100nm size and
    10K primary events will show nice linear correlation.

[6] mutliple grain settings: 

    currently, we have set small units for grain size because if we increase grain size
    units, particle size will be more and for that we need to shoot more primary events.
    only then we can see nice plots similar to [6].

    Use following settings to obtain graphs:

    grainSize(detCon.hh)        events(emanation.mac)    R(emanation.mac/surface radius) (max=19nm)
    100nm                       10k                      99nm        
    1um                         100k                     990nm      
    10um                        1000K                    9.99 um
    100um                       10000K                   99.90um


    in future, we will update this grain sizes with actual grain sizes of stone mountain
    which will most likely in range of 50um to some millimeters. But at that time we 
    also need to shoot more radon particles probably more than 100k. We need to have 
    rough estimation of radium concentration of soil.
