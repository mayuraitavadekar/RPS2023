# Instructions to run simulation

---

- build code using cmake and make

  > mkdir build_sim
  > cd build_sim
  > cmake ../RPS2023
  > make

1. run code interative mode:

   > ./RPS2023
   > /control/execute macro_name.mac

2. run code in batch mode

   > ./RPS2023 macro_name.mac

# commands:

---

after running code in interactive mode, you can optionally use following
commands for better visibility and understanding of detector geometry.

- /vis/viewer/set/style surface OR wireframe
- /vis/viewer/addCutawayPlane 0 1 0
- /vis/viewer/set/background white

More commands to use in macros and interactive console can be found here:

# commit notes (latest from bottom)

---

[1] upto this commit initial data analysis is performed on overall spherical
soil horizon geometry to understand distributions of distance traveled by
radon and other particles in various mediums.

[2] radon emanation study code is added with one soil grain with size 50um.
updated chemical composition for single soil grain from various sources
on web. primary partcle is radon with energy of 86 keV. simulation records
data of radon emanation and data analysis is performed to understand dependance
of radon emanation on moisture. emanation.mac file is used to run this commit code
which assumes that radon atoms are uniformaly distributed in soil grain.
plotEmanationByH2O file should be used for getting plot. Before running this
file you should combine all the data files using hadd mainfile.root file1 file2 ..

[3] this should be considered latest commit for radon emanation study.
plotEmanationByH2O.c macro is updated.

[4] steppingAction is updated with conditions of fStopAndKill track status conditions
to get count of particles which comes to rest after escaping soil grain.

[5] more percentage options are added from 0%, 75% with 5% increase.

[6] all source code files are renamed from prefix nb to RPS2023.
this should be considered as final code for studying radon emanation.
for single grain study comment code of surrounding grains in detConstruction.
for multi-grain study use code as it is.

[7] new function calculateMixtureDensity() to calculate mixture density of composition map
is implemented. XRF data is added in RPS2023PrimaryGeneratorAction::GeneratePrimaries(G4Event* anEvent)
updated with new code. This code randomly choose primary particle position in recoil range.
Overall program running flow lookks like below: 1. add XRF data in DefineXRFChemicalComps() function. 2. // how to find recoil range 3. update the recoil range in RPS2023PrimaryGeneratorAction::GeneratePrimaries(G4Event* anEvent) 4. adjust grain size RPS2023DetectorConstruction.hh file. 5. run code with recoilEmanationParticleGun.mac file
with required number of particles. 6. output file mainfile.root is generated.

[8] input paramaters: grain size, chemical composition, recoil range.
