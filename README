# commands:
-----------

after running code in interactive mode, you can optionally use following
commands for better visibility and understanding of detector geometry.

* /vis/viewer/set/style surface OR wireframe
* /vis/viewer/addCutawayPlane 0 1 0 
* /vis/viewer/set/background white


More commands to use in macros and interactive console can be found here:

# Instructions to run simulation
--------------------------------

* build code using cmake and make

1) run code interative mode:

> ./neutronBall
> /control/execute run.mac

2) run code in batch mode

> ./neutronBall ../neutronBall/run.mac

# commit notes (latest from bottom)
-----------------------------------

[1] upto this commit initial data analysis is performed on overall spherical
soil horizon geometry to understand distributions of distance traveled by
radon and other particles in various mediums.

[2] radon emanation study code is added with one soil grain with size 50um. 
updated chemical composition for single soil grain from various sources 
on web. primary partcle is radon with energy of 86 keV. simulation records 
data of radon emanation and data analysis is performed to understand dependance 
of radon emanation on moisture. emanation.mac file is used to run this commit code
which assumes that radon atoms are uniformaly distributed in soil grain. 
plotEmanationByH2O file should be used for getting plot. Before running this
file you should combine all the data files using hadd mainfile.root file1 file2 ..

[3] this should be considered latest commit for radon emanation study. 
plotEmanationByH2O.c macro is updated.
