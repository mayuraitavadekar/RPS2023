Radon Emanation Simulation
==========================

# usage:
--------

git clone -b test-branch https://github.com/phyxch/neutronBall.git 

# commands:
-----------

* /vis/viewer/set/background white
* /vis/viewer/set/style surface OR wireframe
* /vis/viewer/addCutawayPlane 0 1 0 

# Instructions to run simulation
--------------------------------

* build the code in directory build_nb : using cmake ../neutronBall
* cd build_nb
* ./neutronBall
* under session textbox type: /control/execute fullChain.mac


## Note:
--------
Initially beamOn was set on 100,000 particles but it takes more than 15 mins to run the simulation. Hence beamOn is set to 1000 particles only.


## Tasks:
--------

- [x] understand varible naming conventions and different data members 
- [x] stored all raw data in ntuples
- [ ] create new histograms 
- [ ] read all raw ntuples data using analysis manager reader
- [ ] perform analysis on thorium and radium decays as said by Dr. He
